This contains the code for the servers that conduct the actual battle.

These ones assume we are on a local machine (can probably map network drives) and that the robots are found in the usual robots/ directory - they will be by generations.

They use port 9000, basically register with the server fetch the names of the two contestants and deliver the scores. Sweet and simple. There is a bit of system output so you can see how its going.

more them into the robocode directory and compile with 
javac -classpath libs/robocode.jar:./ RobocodeRunner.java

and run

java -classpath libs/robocode.jar:./ RobocodeRunner

You may have to add more to your classpath etc, but I don't.

:)

Also now in this directory is a tar of the (non standard) human competitors used by spatialRobocodeCreatureDelta. This should be untarred (but leave the jar files) in the robots subdirectory of your robocode directory.
