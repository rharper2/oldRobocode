FILE: gramma (BNF Parser)
AUTHOR: Miguel Nicolau
CURRENT VERSION: 0.63 (April 2001)

To create BNF file one must use a plain text editor such as vi or pico,
emacs won't work!

To compile:
  Just run make. If your system does not have lex and yacc but instead
flex and bison, you will need to change the makefile, replacing "lex"
by "flex", and "yacc" by "bison -y".
Enjoy!
