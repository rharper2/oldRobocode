This is a collection of files that can be used to evolve Robocode tanks using GP
Just now I am ressurecting this just to try and quickly evolve a nanobot.

Assuming I get it working (its probably in quite a state of disrepair since I abandoned this branch
some time ago in favour of trying to get it to work with Stack GP (on going but low time resource project)
so if you clone this don't expect it to work, have instructions or even be comprehenisible.

I will get it working and then change the instructions (soon! <- famous last...)
